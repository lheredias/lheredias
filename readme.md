</p>

✌️ I'm Raul H. a **_full-stack web developer_** based in Lima, Peru 📍 and versed in Python, Ruby, Javascript and SQL 💫.

I'm familiar with deploying `web apps` ✔️ and `APIs` ✔️ through Django and Ruby on Rails, as well as with building `API clients` ✔️ on Javascript and writing `automation scripts` ✔️ and `graphical user interfaces` ✔️ in Python.

To know more about me and my coding journey 💻, you can take a look at **_[my protfolio blog](https://raulheredia.herokuapp.com)_** 📌

On a side note, I shall say that I can speak English 🇺🇸, Spanish 🇪🇸, French 🇫🇷 _und ein bisschen Deutsch_ 🇩🇪 too. Also, I am quite passionate about running, swimming and, most and foremost, cats 🐱.

While my mother tongue is Spanish 🇪🇸, may I hereby state that I possess a good command of both, English 🇺🇸 and French 🇫🇷, and can speak a little German 🇩🇪 too.

I am quite passionate about running and swimming, although the pandemic forced me to almost indoor-cycling only. As of June 2022 though, I am on the way of going back to exercising outdoors 🏃.

On an endnote, yours truly must say I LOVE CATS 🐱 and, as a matter of fact, I have five of those cutie-pie furballs ❤️.
